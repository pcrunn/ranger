ranger ~~is~~ *was* :sob: a console file manager with VI key bindings.  ~~It
provides a minimalistic and nice curses interface with a view on the directory
hierarchy.  It ships with `rifle`, a file launcher that is good at
automatically finding out which program to use for what file type.~~

*Going Forward*
===============

As of today we have decided to stop :no_entry_sign: mucking about with the
boring :neutral_face: and lame :weary: subject matter that is file management.
We had a good run :running:. We are going to focus :mag: on the future :rocket:
now. And the future *is*

:heavy_exclamation_mark: IRangerC :heavy_exclamation_mark:
==========================================================

Yeah, that's right :arrow_right:, we have decided to make a hard turn
:leftwards_arrow_with_hook: and focus :mag: all our efforts :muscle: on what we
believe is *the* communication protocol of the future :rocket:.
:heavy_exclamation_mark:IRC:heavy_exclamation_mark: is not only proven
technology but it also predates the internet. It's like a cockroach :beetle:
that just won't go. In an attempt to live by the wise words "If you can't beat
'em, join 'em," we will turn ranger into the best IRC client ever. A side
benefit in doing this is that people will no longer have an excuse not to come
hang around in #ranger : )
